# Hyperspectral-image-classification-of-control-vs.-infested-apples
This project was for loading the hyperspectral images, doing the pre-processing like cropping, white-dark correction, and scaling, and then the ROI extraction around the calyx end of fruit. Then the spectrum for each pixel in ROI was extracted and saved. These spectra were used to build the classification models for classifying healthy and infested pixels.
